# ToDo List + Theme Switcher

A small project I built with **React, TypeScript and Vite** to practice state management and responsive UI.  
The app is a simple todo list where you can add / remove tasks, mark them as done, and switch between light and dark mode.  
Data is stored in `localStorage` so it doesnâ€™t get lost after refresh.

## Features
- Add, delete and complete tasks
- Dark / light theme toggle
- Data persistence with localStorage
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
